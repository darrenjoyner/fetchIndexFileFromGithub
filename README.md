# GitHub Repository File Downloader

## Overview

This Node.js script allows you to fetch the contents of a specific directory from a GitHub repository, download its files, and open `index.html` in the default web browser. It utilizes GitHub API for fetching repository contents and `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Generate a personal access token on GitHub with `repo` scope to authenticate requests. You can create a token in your GitHub account settings.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url.git>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the Script:**

   - Open `index.js` in your favorite code editor.
   - Provide the following details in the script:

     ```javascript
     const organizationName = 'YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME';
     const repoName = 'YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME';
     const branchName = 'YOUR_BRANCH_NAME';
     const accessToken = 'YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN';
     const directoryPath = 'PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY';
     ```

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```
node index.js
```

The script will fetch the contents of the specified directory from the GitHub repository, download its files, and open `index.html` in the default web browser if it exists.

## Customization

- **Change the `directoryPath` Variable:**
  Modify the `directoryPath` variable in `index.js` to specify a different directory within the repository to download files from.

- **Customize the Script:**
  You can customize the script to handle different file types or perform additional operations on the downloaded files as per your requirements.

## Important Note

- **Keep your GitHub Personal Access Token secure. Do not share it or expose it publicly.**
